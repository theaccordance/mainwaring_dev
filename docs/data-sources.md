# Data Sources

## Outline
- Philsophy
  - Sometimes to work with certain ideas, you need a relevant dataset to work with.  This has been a barrier before with past ideas.  
  - Manual data entry is labor-intensive, ideally you should be able to pull data sets from pre-existing sources
  - Public APIs are common and a morally unambigious way to build a data set.
  - Scraping is another way which I have not tried.
  - SQL vs NoSQL
    - Postgres was the primary data source for this environment based on my decision to use Strapi as the API.
    - I view both SQL and NOSQL favorably.  They are two different tools, and while they can solve many of the same problems, they both excel at different tasks.  It's about picking the right tool for the job.
