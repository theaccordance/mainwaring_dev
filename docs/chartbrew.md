[**Chartbrew**](https://chartbrew.com) **is an open-source web application that can connect directly to databases and APIs and use the data to create beautiful charts. It features a chart builder, editable dashboards, embedable charts, query & requests editor, and team capabilities.**

### Data sources

Currently, Chartbrew supports connections to these data sources.

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* Firestore
* Realtime Database
* Google Analytics
* Customer.io
* REST APIs

Chartbrew also features dashboard templates with charts already prepared:

* Simple Analytics
* ChartMogul
* Mailgun
* Google Analytics

...or you can create your **custom templates** and replicate them across multiple dashboards.

### Prerequisites

* NodeJS v12 (should also work with v10)
  * For M1 Macs you might need the latest v14 or v15
* NPM
* MySQL (5+) or PostgreSQL (12.5+)

### Start

It is recommended you head over to the more detailed documentation to find out how to set up Chartbrew

[üìö You can find it here](https://docs.chartbrew.com/#getting-started)

### Quickstart

If you already have a MySQL or PostgreSQL server running, create a database called `chartbrew` and follow the prompts of the `create-chartbrew-app` command below.

**Important** Windows command line is not supported at the moment. Use something like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) on Windows.

```
npx create-chartbrew-app chartbrew
```

The CLI tool creates a `chartbrew/.env` file which you can configure at any time if you want to change the database, API & client host, etc. The file contains comments explaining what each environmental variable is for. [Check out which need to be set here.](https://docs.chartbrew.com/#set-up-environmental-variables)

#### Run the project in Development

Open two terminals, one for front-end and the other for back-end.

```
# frontend
cd client/
npm run start

# backend
cd server/
npm run start-dev
```

### Run with Docker

[Check the full guide in the docs.](https://docs.chartbrew.com/deployment/#run-the-application-with-docker)

#### Quickstart

A [Chartbrew docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/razvanilin/chartbrew) is built whenever a new version is released.

Before running the commands below, make sure you have a MySQL server already running and an empty database that Chartbrew can use. The database name should match the value of the `CB_DB_NAME` variable.

For `amd64` architecture:

```
docker pull razvanilin/chartbrew

docker run -p 4019:4019 -p 4018:4018 \
  -e CB_SECRET=enter_a_secure_string \
  -e CB_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e CB_API_PORT=4019 \
  -e CB_DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e CB_DB_NAME=chartbrew \
  -e CB_DB_USERNAME=root \
  -e CB_DB_PASSWORD=password \
  -e REACT_APP_CLIENT_HOST=http://localhost:4018 \
  -e REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://localhost:4019 \
  razvanilin/chartbrew
```

For `arm64` architecture:

```
docker pull razvanilin/chartbrew:latest-arm64

docker run -p 4019:4019 -p 4018:4018 \
  -e CB_SECRET=enter_a_secure_string \
  -e CB_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e CB_API_PORT=4019 \
  -e CB_DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e CB_DB_NAME=chartbrew \
  -e CB_DB_USERNAME=root \
  -e CB_DB_PASSWORD=password \
  -e REACT_APP_CLIENT_HOST=http://localhost:4018 \
  -e REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://localhost:4019 \
  razvanilin/chartbrew:latest-arm64
```
